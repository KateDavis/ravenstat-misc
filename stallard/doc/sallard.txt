PURPOSE

This document  is my  supplemental/rebuttal  expert  report  for  the W.R. Grace & Co., et al., Case 
No. 01-1139 (JKF).  

The  report  has  two  parts.    In  Part  I,  I  offer  my  opinions  on  the  assumptions,  methods, and 
procedures used by B. Thomas Florence, Ph.D., in making his est imates of the number and value 
of pending and future asbestos personal injury claims. 

These opinions  reflect  my  experience in  data  analysis,  statist ical  est imat ion,  modeling, and 
forecast ing  in  the  areas  o f  population  health  and  aging,  with  specific  expertise  in  the 
epidemio logy and modeling of asbestos-related diseases and claims.   I approached  this  task with 
a  level  of  scrutiny  similar  to  what  I  would  apply  in  conduct ing scient ific  peer-review  for 
submissions  to professional  journals in my  field.    In  scient ific peer-review  there are o ften one or 
two other reviewers with complementary areas of expert ise.   This  is also  the case with respect  to 
the  Florence  rebuttal  reports,  with  Victor  L.  Roggli,  M.D., opining on  medical  criteria  and 
Jennifer L. Biggs, F.S.A., M.A.A.A., opining on actuarial aspects, both of which complement my 
report.  

In Part  II,  I present  supplemental project ions  o f  the  number  of male  claims  against  the Manville 
Trust  by disease,  date  of  first  exposure,  and  date  of  claim  for  the  period  2005–2009  through 
2055–2059.  I  also  provided  these  supplemental  project ions  to  Jennifer  L.  Biggs  for  use  in  her 
supplemental/rebuttal expert report dated September 25, 2007.  

I  was  asked  to  prepare  this  report  on  behalf  of  David  T.  Austern,  the  Court-Appointed  Future 
Claimants’ Representative.  

I  reserve  the  right  to modify  this report as new  information becomes  available between now  and 
the  time  o f  trial.    I  anticipate  that  I  will  review  the  supplemental/rebuttal  expert  reports  of 
opposing experts and may o ffer my opinions about their analyses and conclusions in a rebuttal or 
supplemental report or at trial.

STATEMENT OF OPINIONS 

1. The  methods  and  procedures  used  by  B.  Thomas  Florence  were  inappropriate  for  the  stated 
goal o f making  est imates  of  the  total  number  and  value  of  pending  and  future asbestos 
personal  injury  claims  against W.R.  Grace  (“Grace”)  as  of  April  2,  2001  because  they  were 
designed  to  produce  an  est imated  value  which  was  not  a  complete  est imate  of  Grace’s 
liability. Florence’s  est imated  value  was  fundamentally  different  from  (a)  the  est imated 
values  of  Grace’s  liability  reported  by Biggs  and  Peterson,  respectively,  in  their  expert 
reports  submitted  in  June  2007  and  (b)  the  values  reported  by  Florence  in  Sect ions  1.0  and 
1.1  of his  report  describing  other work  he  himself  has  performed in  the  area  of  valuing  and 
estimat ing asbestos liabilit ies in connect ion with asbestos trusts and manufacturers.

This  opinion  is  based  on  Florence’s  descript ions  of  the  est imat ion  task  that  he was  asked  to 
perform, which  clearly  indicate  that Florence’s estimates excluded  large numbers o f pending 
and future claims and associated costs:  
In  the  first  sentence  of  his  report  (Section  1.0)  he  stated  that  his  company  (ARPC)  “… 
•
was  asked  to  prepare  an  est imate  of  the  number  and  value  o f  valid  pending  and  future 
asbestos-related  personal  injury  claims  under  assumpt ions  regarding  the  evidence 
required to demonstrate the validity o f the claims.”  
• On  page  2  (Section  1.2),  he  stated:  “These  assumpt ions  are  based  on  the  premise  that 
only  claimants  whose  claims  met  the  fo llowing  criteria  would  be  able  to  sustain  their 
burden  o f  proof  that  their  claims  against  Grace  are  valid,  and  therefore,  their  claims 
should  be  valued  as  part  of  the  est imation  process:  …”    Fo llowing  a  list ing  of  seven 
“evident iary  criteria”,  he  commented:    “In  a  typical asbestos  bankruptcy est imat ion,  the 
informat ion  necessary  for  determining which  claims would meet  these  criteria would  not 
be available.”   He  then cited  the Court ordered requirements for pending claimants  to file 
PIQs  and  POCs,  and  commented  (on  page  3):  “The  data  gleaned  from  these  two 
requirements allowed the estimat ion of valid Grace claims based on the above criteria.” 
• On  page  3  (Section  2.0),  he  began  his  Opinion  with:    “ARPC  estimated  the  Grace 
pending  and  future  asbestos  personal
injury  claim  liability  under  the  specified 
assumpt ions.”  He then referred to the criteria on page 2 as the “evidentiary criteria.”
• On page 6 (Sect ion 4.0), he began his descript ion of the Pending Claims Est imat ion with:  
“Grace asked ARPC  to assume  that only  the claimants whose claims met specific criteria 
will  be  able  to  sustain  their  burden  of  proof  that  the  claims  against  Grace  are  valid  and 
therefore compensable.”  
• On  page  8  (Section  4.2.2),  Florence  stated:    “ARPC  was  asked  to  assume  that  only 
historical  pending  claimants  whose  claims  also met  the  fo llowing  criteria would  be  able 
to  sustain  their  burden  of  proof  that  their  claims  against  Grace  are  valid,  and  therefore, 
their  claims  should  be  valued  as  part  of  the  estimation  process: …”  after which  he  listed 
the Grace exposure criteria.
• On  page  16  (Section  5.1), Florence  stated:    “Grace  asked ARPC  to  assume  that  only  the 
claimants whose  claims met  specific  criteria will  be  able  to  sustain  their  burden  of proof 
that the claims against Grace are valid and therefore compensable.”  
• On  page  21  (Sect ion  7.0),  he  began  his  Conclusion  with:  “ARPC  was  asked  to  estimate 
the Grace  number  and  value  of  pending  and  future  asbestos  personal  injury  claims  under 
the  assumpt ion  that only  claimants whose  claims met  the  required  criteria will  be  able  to 
sustain  their burden of proof  that  their claims against Grace are valid, and  therefore,  their 
claims should be valued as part of the estimat ion process.”

Taken  together,  these  statements  indicate  that  Florence’s  methods  and  procedures  were 
designed  to  exclude  all  pending  and  future  claims  and  associated  costs  relat ing  to  claimants 
who  would  not  be  expected  to  meet  the  required  “evident iary  criteria”.    Moreover,  they 
indicate  that  Grace,  not  Florence,  was  responsible  for  the  specificat ion  o f  the  assumpt ions 
regarding  the evident iary criteria used  to  include or exclude  these claims from  the est imation 
procedure.  

Florence’s est imates are based on the unsupported assumpt ion (page 21) that “only claimants 
whose  claims met  the  required  criteria will  be  able  to  sustain  their  burden  of proof  that  their 
claims  against  Grace  are  valid,  and  therefore,  their  claims  should  be  valued  as  part  of  the 
estimat ion  process.”    As  further  explained  on  pages  6  and  16,  these  would  be  the  only 
4

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 6 of 33

claimants  whose  claims  “against  Grace  are  valid  and  therefore  compensable.”    It  fo llows 
logically  that  all  excluded  claims would  be  noncompensable with  zero-dollar  liability  values 
in the tort system from April 2, 2001 onward.  

Florence  took  no  responsibility  for  these  assumptions;  he  accepted  Grace’s  assumpt ions 
without  comment ing  on  their  appropriateness  for  the  task  of  est imat ing  the  total  value  of 
Grace’s asbestos-related personal injury liabilit ies.  

Most  importantly,  Florence  o ffered  no  evidence  that  the  claims  excluded  from  his  estimates 
could  be  reasonably  expected  to  be  noncompensable  with  zero-dollar  liability  values  in  the 
tort system from April 2, 2001 onward.

Given  his  extensive  and  lengthy  experience  in  estimat ing  asbestos  liabilit ies  in  connection 
with more  than  20  asbestos  manufacturers  and  trusts  (page  1)  and  the  crit ical  role  o f  the 
assumpt ion  that  these  claims  would  be  noncompensable  with  zero-dollar  liability  values  in 
the  tort  system  from  April  2,  2001  onward,  I  expected  him to  provide  some  evidence  that 
these excluded claims would be noncompensable.  The fact that he did not do so supports my 
opinion that his est imates of Grace’s liability are incomplete.  

Victor  L.  Roggli,  M.D.  reviewed  the  evident iary  criteria  used  by  Florence  and  concluded 
that:  “these  criteria  are  not medically  sound,  and  any  estimate  based  on  these  criteria  would 
be  flawed.”    (Roggli,  2007,  page  1).   Moreover,  I  am  unaware  of  any  tort  reform  proposals 
that  would  result  in  limit ing  “valid  claims” to  those  that  meet  the  evidentiary  criteria 
specified by Grace and fo llowed by Florence. 

To  the extent  that  the claims  excluded  by  Florence  from  his  est imates would  have  a  liability 
consistent  with  their  historical  values  in  the  tort  system,  the  estimates  reported  by  Florence 
are  significantly  and  materially  downward-biased.    Indeed,  using  the  difference  between 
Florence’s estimated values o f Grace’s  liability and  those reported by Biggs or Peterson, one 
can show  that  the excluded costs constitute a  large majority of Grace’s  liability as of April 2, 
2001.  

Because  Florence’s  est imates  excluded  large  numbers  o f  claims  and  associated  costs,  these 
estimates  are  unscient ific,  downwardly  biased,  and  of  no  assistance  to  the  Court  for  the 
purpose  of  determining Grace’s  total liability  fo r  asbestos-related  personal  injuries  as  o f 
April 2, 2001.  

2. The  methods  and  procedures  used  by  Florence  were  inappropriate  for  the  goal  of  making 
estimates of the value of the pending and future asbestos personal injury claims against Grace 
as  of  April  2,  2001  among  claimants  who  could  meet  the  evident iary  criteria  specified  by 
Grace.  

This  opinion  is  based  on  a  fundamental  inconsistency  between  the methods  used  to  estimate 
the  number  of  claims  that  would  receive  indemnity  payments  and  the  methods  used  to 
estimate the average values of those indemnity payments.  

My  understanding  o f  the  requirements  of  the  estimat ion  phase  of  the  trial  is  that  the 
estimat ion o f Grace’s pending and future liabilit ies relating to asbestos personal injury claims 
5

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 7 of 33

must  be  conducted  under  a  “no-bankruptcy”  assumpt ion  whereby  the  estimat ion  procedure 
assumes  that  the Grace bankruptcy filing on April 2, 2001 did not occur and  that new claims 
would  have  cont inued  to  be  filed  and  settled,  along  with  pending  claims,  through  the  tort 
system.  

My understanding of  the reason for  the “no-bankruptcy” assumpt ion  is  that  it allows  the  total 
value  of  Grace’s  pending  and  future  liabilit ies  relating  to  asbestos  personal  injury  claims  to 
be  est imated  and  treated  as  if  it had  become  fixed  immediately  before  the  filing  o f  the 
bankruptcy pet ition,  and  in  a  manner  that  would  not  be  influenced  by  the  fact  that  the 
bankruptcy pet it ion  was  filed  on  April  2,  2001,  or  on  any  date  thereafter,  or  not  at  all.  
Equivalently,  my  understanding  is  that  the  est imation  o f  the  total value  of  those  liabilit ies 
should  be  conducted  without  consideration  o f  the  protections  o ffered  to  Grace  through 
bankruptcy and without regard to the resources that Grace may ho ld to offset those liabilit ies.  

The  generally  accepted  approach  to  constructing  an  estimat ion  model  under  the  “no-
bankruptcy” assumpt ion would be  to assume  that  the  filing and settlement process beginning 
at  the  date  of  the  bankruptcy petit ion  would  be  a  continuat ion  of  the  filing  and  settlement 
process  in  place  immediately  before  the  filing  of  the  bankruptcy  petit ion,  with due 
consideration  given  to  changes  in  the  tort  system  that  have  occurred  during  the  bankruptcy 
period  from 2001  to  the  present  as  well  as  to  changes  that  can  be  reasonably  ant icipated  in 
future  years.    This  was  the  approach  used  by  Biggs  and  Peterson  in  their  June  2007  expert 
reports.

In  contrast,  as  noted  above  in  Opinion  1,  Florence’s  est imates  were  based  on  the  flawed 
assumpt ion – dictated  to  him  by  Grace  – that  the only  claimants  who  would  receive 
indemnity payments during  the bankruptcy period  from 2001  to  the present, and  in all  future 
years, would be those who could meet the evident iary criteria now specified by Grace, which 
are  contrary to  the  criteria  Grace  actually  used  to  settle  cases  pre-bankruptcy.    This 
assumpt ion  represented  a  radical  departure  from  the  filing  and  settlement  criteria in  place 
immediately before the filing o f the bankruptcy petit ion.  

The assumption that the historical claim settlement procedures in effect prior to April 2, 2001 
would be  replaced by  the ent irely new and unprecedented claim  settlement procedures based 
on Grace’s  specified  evident iary  criteria  was  implicit  in  Florence’s  report. Florence  did  not 
discuss  it  and  it  would  not  be  apparent  that  such  an  assumption  had  been  made  without  the 
simultaneous  recognit ion  that  the  no-bankruptcy  assumpt ion  was  a  requirement  of  the 
estimat ion phase of the bankruptcy proceeding.  

Explicit considerat ion  o f  this  implic it assumpt ion  reveals  a  fundamental
inconsistency 
between  the  methods  used  to  estimate  the  number  of  claims  that  would  receive  indemnit y 
payments and the methods used to estimate the average values of those indemnity payments.  

Florence  provided  a  descript ion  of  how  the  number  o f compensable  pending  and  future 
claims  would  be  changed  under  the  new  claim  settlement  procedure  but  he  implicit ly 
assumed that the average value of the indemnity payments awarded to those claims would not 
change as a result of the new procedures from their inflat ion-adjusted historical values.

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 8 of 33

Specifically:  
“To  value  the  est imated  pending  malignancy  claims,  ARPC  analyzed  Grace’s  historical 
•
settlement data …  in  the Closed Claim sample  that met  the criteria  ...” (page 15).   In  this 
case, “malignancy” referred only to mesothelioma and lung cancer.
• To  value  the  est imated  pending  malignancy  claims,  the  historical  average  settlement 
values  during April  1999  to April  2001 were  adjusted  for  inflat ion  at  2.5%  per  year  and 
all values were converted to 2001 dollars.  (page 15)  
• To value the est imated pending nonmalignancy claims and other-cancer claims (i.e., other 
than  mesothelioma  and  lung  cancer),  ARPC  applied  historical  cost  factors  from  four 
trusts to lung cancer settlement values.  (page 15)  
• To  value  the  est imated  future  claims  for  all  diseases,  the  historical  average  disease-
specific  settlement  values  were  init ially  expressed  in  2001  do llars  and  were  adjusted  for 
subsequent  inflat ion at 2.5% per year  through 2007 and 1.0% per year  thereafter.   (pages 
18–19)  

The  inflat ion-adjusted  settlement  values  were  based  on  the  historical settlement  experience 
for  a  subset  of  claims  in  the  tort  system  preceding  the  Grace  bankruptcy  filing  that  would 
have  met  the  new  evident iary  criteria  specified  by  Grace,  had  those  criteria  been  applied  at 
the  time  those  claims were  settled.  However,  inflat ion-adjusted  historical  settlement  values 
are not appropriate for  the est imat ion of  the future costs of similar claims under substant ially 
different  settlement  condit ions  such  as  those  that  would  have  occurred  had  the  new  claim 
settlement  procedures  based  on Grace’s  evident iary  criteria  been  implemented  as  of April  2, 
2001.1  

To  the extent  that  the settlement conditions were substantially altered, my expectation would 
be  that  the  average  payments would  also  be  substant ially  altered.    The  size  and  direct ion  o f 
the  changes  would  depend  on  the  changes  in  the  settlement  conditions.    Given  the  highly 
restrict ive form o f Grace’s proposed evident iary criteria, my expectation would be that Grace 
would  have  a  greater  share  o f  the  total  liability  for  claims  meet ing  those  criteria,  with  the 
average payments to those claimants  increasing substantially.  

The crit ical quest ion is how large would the  increases be?  

Florence  implicit ly assumed that the size of the changes would be zero for mesothelioma and 
lung  cancer  claims,2 yielding  the  values  of  $135,860  and  $34,673,  respectively, in  his  Table 
4-12.  To be sure, he only used historical claims that met Grace's new evident iary criteria, but 
those historical claims do not reflect  the higher portion of  the  total  liability  that Grace would 
bear on those claims. 

It  is  informat ive  to  illustrate  the  potential  changes  that  might  occur  if  one  used  a  more
reasonable,  but  still  conservat ive, set  of alternative  values  for  claimants  who  would  meet  
Grace’s criteria but not  those of any other asbestos defendant.   Such values could be derived 
from the 2005 Senate Bill S. 852 (pages 92–93) which listed a scheduled value o f $1,100,000 

 
 
1 Inflation-adjusted  historical  settlement  values  are  appropriate  for  the  estimation  of  the  future  costs  of  similar 
claims under a continuation of the historical claim settlement procedures.  
2 The claim values for other diseases were based on the value for lung cancer (page 15).  
7

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 9 of 33

for mesothelioma, and a set of  three scheduled values – $600,000, $975,000, and $1,100,000 
– for lung cancer, with the specific award dependent on smoking status.  

Addit ional adjustments could be developed to account for claimants who met Grace’s criteria 
and  also  met  those  of one  or  more  other  asbestos  defendants,  under  the  conservative 
assumpt ion  that  the S. 852 values  represented  the  total  amounts  that would be  awarded  from 
all defendants.  This assumption  is conservat ive because there is considerable evidence in the 
public domain that the settlement amounts set forth in S. 852 are far lower than what asbestos 
claimants actually co llect in total from all defendants, particularly for mesothelioma claims.  

For  example,  during  the  Armstrong confirmat ion  hearing  in  May  2006,  Daniel  Myer,  a 
claims settlement negotiator who was currently settling cases for Union Carbide and who has 
settled  over  400,000  asbestos  personal  injury  claims  in  his  career  for  asbestos  defendants, 
testified  that  the  ‘total  gross  value”  of  a  typical  mesothelioma  case  (i.e.  the  sum  paid  by  all 
defendants  to  the  plaint iff  to  settle  the  case)  in  2006  was  between  $5  and  $8  million,  as 
compared  to  $2.5  to  $3.5  million in  1999–2000  (Armstrong 5/23/06  AM  Transcript,  pages 
26–27).    At  the  same  hearing,  Lester  Brickman,  who  is  well  known  in  the  field  of  asbestos 
lit igat ion, agreed  that mesothelioma values have  roughly doubled between  the year 2000 and 
2006 (Armstrong 5/25/06 PM Transcript, page 98).  Thus, the settlement amounts set forth in 
S.  852 in  2005  were  far  below  the  values  cited  by  Myer  for  a  period  five  years  earlier,  and 
they took  no  account  of  an  approximate  doubling  since  that  time cited  by  both  Myer  and 
Brickman.  

The  settlement  amounts  set  forth  in  S.  852 in  2005  appear  even  more  conservat ive  when 
compared  with jury-verdict  amounts.    For  example,  a 2005  RAND  report  noted  that  the 
average  jury  verdict  in  mesothelioma  cases  over  the  1993–2001  t ime  period  was  almost  $4 
million,  rising  to  over  $6  million  in  2001  (the  most  recent  year  for  which  data  was  cited  in 
the report) (Carroll et al., 2005, pages 53–54).3  The same report also noted that “it  is widely 
assumed  that  trends  in  settlement  values  o f  cases  reflect  trends  in  jury  awards  (perhaps with 
some lag).”  (Carroll et al., 2005, page 49).

There  is  no  recognit ion  in  Florence’s  report  of  the  need  to  estimate  the  changes  in  average 
payments that would result from the implementation of Grace’s new and much more rigorous
criteria.  

Using  the  conservative  S.  852  average  values  as  a  proxy for  the  average settlement  values 
under  Grace's  new  criteria,  Grace's  total  liability  is  many  times  higher  than  the  value 
calculated by Florence:  

• For  mesothelioma,  S.  852’s  scheduled  value  is  7.34  times  larger  than Florence’s 
value, after adjusting for inflat ion during 2001–2005; 

 
 
3 The  same  source also  reported that  asbestosis  verdicts  during  the  same  time  period  were  $1.63 million,  nearly 
double  that  of  S.  852’s  highest  scheduled  value  for  asbestosis  ($850,000).   Lung  cancer  values were  included with 
other  non-mesothelioma  malignant  diseases  in  the  combined  category  “other  cancers”,  with  average  verdicts  of 
$1.33  million,  more  than  20%  above  the  highest  of  S.  852’s  scheduled  three  values  ($600,000,  $975,000,  and 
$1,100,000)  for  lung cancer, and more  than double  the  lowest value  ($600,000)  selected  for  illustrative purposes  for  
this opinion.

• For  lung  cancer,  the  corresponding  inflat ion-adjusted  ratios  are  15.68,  25.48,  and 
28.74,  respectively,  for  the  three  smoking  statuses.    Applying  the  7.34  mult iplier  for 
mesothelioma  and  the  smallest of the  three  mult ipliers for  lung  cancer (15.68)  to  the 
median pro ject ions  in Florence’s Table 6-3 yields a  total pro ject ion o f $7.708 billion,  
10.8 times larger than Florence’s project ion of $712 million.  

An  alternat ive  set  of  assumpt ions  based  on  Grace’s  actual  trial  history was  employed  by
Peterson  in  his  June  2007  expert  report  (pages  95–96).   These calculat ions  indicated  that  the 
total liabilit ies  for  pending  and  future  claims  could  be  in  the  range  of  $30–40  billion, which 
would  be  42–56  t imes  larger  than  Florence’s  project ion  o f  $712  million,  but  with  the 
liabilit ies for pending claims increased by a smaller mult iplier in the range of 7–8.  

Peterson  (pages  39–41 in  his  June  2007  expert  report)  presented  a  compelling  case  why  the 
bottom end  o f  the  range would  not  be  below  1.0,  i.e.,  below  100%  of  the  historical  average 
settlement values.   There  he documented “the  inseparability of payment  rates  and  settlement  
values”  under  which  the  individual  claim  settlement  amounts  are posit ively  correlated  with 
the quality or strength of  the claims in such a way  that stronger claims generally have  higher 
settlement  values.    E liminat ing weaker  claims  based  on  criteria  like  those  assumed  by 
Florence  would  necessarily  retain for  payment  a  subset  of  stronger  claims  whose  average 
payments  would  be greater  than  the  combined  average  for both  types  of  claims,  which, 
before adjusting for inflat ion, is equal to 100% of the historical average settlement values.

Thus,  the  uncertainty  o f  the  range  is  effect ively  restricted  to  the  upper  limit,  e.g.,  to  a 
mult iplier such as 7, 8, 10.8, 42, or 56 as indicated above.  

These  comparisons  indicate  that  the  locat ion  of  the  upper  end  o f  the  relat ive  range  o f 
uncertainty  is  itself  highly  uncertain  and  can  vary  substant ially  depending  on  the  specific 
assumpt ions  used  in  its calculat ion.    The  calculations  indicate  that  the  relat ive  range  o f 
uncertainty  is  large,  e.g.,  at  least  7  to  1,  but  they  do  not  allow  one  to  quantify  its  size  with 
confidence.   Indeed,  the relat ive range of uncertainty (7, 8, 10.8, 42, or 56 to 1, from high to 
low)  is  so  large  that  it  renders  Florence’s  project ions  useless  for  purposes  of  informing  the 
estimat ion process.  

Florence’s  assumpt ion  that  there  would  be  no  change  in  the  size  o f  the  historic  average 
settlement values  for mesothelioma and  lung cancer claims that met Grace's new criteria was 
equivalent  to  assuming  that  the  appropriate  adjustment  factor was  at  the extreme lower  limit  
of  an  extraordinarily  large  uncertainty  range.    Given  the  extraordinarily  large  size  of  this 
uncertainty  range,  I  conclude  that  Florence’s  assumpt ion  was  biased  and his  est imate  is 
useless and highly misleading.  

3. The  data  used  by  Florence  to  estimate  the  average  values  of  historical  settlement  amounts 
paid to claimants who could meet the evident iary criteria specified by Grace were inadequate 
for  that  purpose.    Specifically,  the  statistical  sampling  methods  used  by  Florence  yielded 
sample  sizes  that  were  inadequate  for  the  purpose  of  generat ing  reliable  est imates  o f  the 

9

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 11 of 33

average values among the targeted population consist ing of all claimants who could have met  
the evident iary criteria specified by Grace.4  

This opinion  is based on my  review of  the data contained  in  the Excel workbook “Settlement  
averages in Sample Apr99 to Apr00.xls” provided in Florence’s reliance materials.  

Tabulat ions of  those data revealed  that  the average values of $135,860 for mesothelioma and 
$34,673  for  lung  cancer were based on  sample  sizes of 21  claims  and 7  claims,  respectively.   
The average values were  reported by Florence in his Table 4-12.   However,  the sample sizes 
were  not  reported  nor  was  there  any  discussion  of the  fact  that  these  sample  sizes  were 
inadequate for the purposes of generat ing reliable estimates of the average values.  

The  generally  accepted  standard  for  full  credibility  in  actuarial  pract ice  is  a  sample  size  o f 
1,082 claims (Herzog, 1999, pages 59–60).5 The 1,082-standard  is designed  to yield average 
values  that  are within  ±5%  of  the  true  values  “most  of  the  t ime”,  where  the  latter  condition 
was  operationalized  to  mean  90%  of  the  time.    This  is  a  technical  concept  that  can  be 
understood  by stating  that  actuaries  who  used  the  1,082-standard  throughout  their  careers 
could  expect  that  about  90%  of  their  est imates  would  fall  within  ±5%  o f  the  true  values, 
assuming that the true values eventually became known to them so that this assessment could 
be conducted.

The  1,082-standard  is  51.5  times  larger  than  Florence’s  mesothelioma  sample  size  o f  21 
claims  and  154.6  times  larger  than  Florence’s  lung  cancer  sample  size  of  7.    Thus,  I  would 
have expected  that Florence would have provided some acknowledgement and/or assessment 
of the potential impact on his analysis of such small sample sizes.  

The  impact  of  the  small  sample  size  can  be  represented  by  considering  how  much  the  ±5%  
error  tolerance  in  the  1,082-standard  would  need  to  be  increased  to  match  the  condit ion  in 
that standard that the average values must be within ±X% of the true values 90% of the time.   
Under  the  so-called  “normal  approximat ion,”  Florence’s  data  indicate  that  X  =  47.6  for 
mesothelioma and 58.9 for lung cancer.  

In other words, Florence’s data would have allowed him  to state with a  reasonable degree of 
confidence  that  the  est imated  average  value  o f  $135,860  for  mesothelioma  was  within 
±47.6%  of  the  true  value  among  claimants  who  could  have  met  the  evident iary  criteria 
specified  by  Grace;  and  with  an  equivalent  level  of  confidence  that  the  estimated  average 
value  of  $34,673  for  lung  cancer  was  within  ±58.9%  of  the  true  value  among  the  same 
claimants.  This  is an extraordinarily large uncertainty range. 

 
 
4 Opinion 3 differs  from Opinion 2  in the  following way.   Even  if  reliable estimates of  the average historical values 
could be generated, Opinion 2 states  that such estimates would be  inappropriate  for  the goal of making estimates of 
the value of the pending and future asbestos personal injury claims against Grace because they would not include the 
changes  in  the  historical  values  that  would  occur  as  a  result  of  the  assumed  changes  in  the  settlement  conditions.  
Opinion 3 states that Florence’s report failed to provide reliable estimates of the average historical values.  
5 Frequently, however, it is necessary to work with smaller sample sizes in which case the analyst would determine 
whether the smaller sample size materially impacted the reliability of the resulting estimates and, if so, would make 
appropriate adjustments to deal with the effects.  Here, it was not necessary to use a sample less than 1,082 and, in 
any case, Florence made no appropriate adjustment.  

10

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 12 of 33

Florence's error tolerances are 9.5 and 11.8  times  larger,  respectively,  than  the standard ±5% 
error  tolerance.    These  very  large  error  tolerances reflect  the  fact  that  the  sample  sizes  used 
by Florence are inadequate.  They also indicate that Florence's average settlement values may 
be in error by factors in the range of 1.5–1.6. In other words, the actual settlement values for 
all such claims could be up to 50–60% higher (or lower) than est imated by Florence.  

Moreover,  the  error  tolerances  for  Florence’s  estimates  may  be  substantially  larger  than 
indicated above.   This  is because  the “normal approximation” assumptions  I used are among 
the most favorable that I could have selected. 

Florence  attempted to  gloss  over  this  crit ical  credibility problem  by  using  the  settlement 
values  o f  only  those  historic  settlements  that  met  the  Grace-imposed  criteria.    However, 
Florence  failed here  as well  because  there was  no  statist ically  significant  difference  between 
those  settlements  and  the  other  settlements Graces  paid.6   In  other words,  Florence assumed
that  the  new  Grace  imposed  criteria  would  have  made  no  difference  on  the  historic 
settlements.  

Figure  1  displays  the  settlement  amounts  for  the  21  mesothelioma  claims  that  met  Grace’s 
criteria  along with the  settlement  amounts  for  the  81  other  claims  in Florence’s  data  that  did 
not  meet  Grace’s  criteria.    Within  each  group  the  data  were  sorted  in  ascending  order  by 
settlement  amount.    The  scaling  of  the  vertical  axis  was  set  so  that  the  first  horizontal  bar 
appears  at  the  average  value  ($135,860)  for  the  21  mesothelioma  claims  that  met  Grace’s 
criteria.

One  can  see  that  only  7  o f  the  21  claims  (33%)  in  the  first  group  had  values  above  the 
average  as  did  13  of  the  81  claims  in  the  second  group.    The  average  value  in  the  second 
group was $100,696, a value exceed by 18 of the 81 claims (22%).  

As  noted  above,  the  differences  in  average  values  between  the  two  groups  were  not 
statist ically significant.   This means  that Florence had no reliable evidence  that  the payments 
to the full set of claimants who would have met Grace’s evident iary criteria for mesothelioma 
were  actually  larger  on  average  than  the  payments  to  the  claimants who would  not  have met 
those  criteria.   In other  words,  the  size  of  the  payments in  the  historical  data  has  not  been 
shown to be related to the evidentiary criteria now proposed by Grace.  Florence’s data fail to 
prove  that claimants meet ing  those  criteria  benefited by  receiving  larger settlement  amounts.  
Thus,  the  average  settlement  value  for  the  21  claimants  in  Figure  1 who met  those  criteria  is 
not  representative  of  the  average  settlement  values  that  would  have  occurred  had  Grace 
actually  implemented the  new  claim  settlement  procedures  based  on  the evident iary  criteria 
in Florence’s report.  

The  settlement  values  in  the  first  group  ranged  from  $15,375  to  $768,750,  a  factor  of  50.  
Given  that  all  of  these  claims  met  Grace’s  evident iary  criteria,  I  would  have  expected  that 
Florence’s  report  would  have  provided  some  assessment  of  the  condit ions  that  led  to  this 
huge settlement different ial.  

The  settlement  values  in  the  second  group  ranged  from  $1,000  to  $1,000,000,  a  factor  of 
1,000.    Given  that  none  o f  these  claims  met  Grace’s  evidentiary  criteria,  I  would  also  have 
expected  that Florence’s  report would  have  provided  some  assessment of  the  condit ions  that  
led  to  the  huge  settlements  for  the  6  highest  claim  values  ($358,750  and  above),  especially 
given  the  observat ion  in  Opinion  1  that  he  assigned  zero-dollar  values  to  all  similar  claims 
filed on April 2, 2001 or later.  Florence provided no such assessment. 

Figure  2  displays  the  corresponding  data  for  lung  cancer.   The  differences  in  average  values 
between  the  two  groups,  though  relat ively larger  ($34,673  vs.  $15,570),  were  also  not 
statist ically  significant.7 Again,  this  means  that  Florence  had  no  reliable  evidence  that  the 
claim  payments  to  the  full  set  of  claimants who would  have met Grace’s  evident iary  criteria 
for  lung  cancer  were  actually larger  on  average  than  the  payments  to  the  claimants  who 
would not have met those criteria.  

The settlement values in the first group ranged from $1,538 to $76,875, a factor of 50; and in 
the  second group,  from $1,025  to $200,000,  a  factor of 195.  The  settlement  amounts  for  the 
three  largest  claims  in  the  second  group  were  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  largest  settlement 
amounts  for  the  claims  in  the  first  group.   As  noted  above, Florence’s  est imat ion procedures 
assigned zero-dollar values to all similar claims filed on April 2, 2001 or later.

4. The median forecasted  liability o f $712 million reported by Florence was based on a set of 32 
individual  forecasts  with  liabilit ies  ranging  from  $385  million  to  $1,314  million.    The  32 
individual forecasts were formed by combinat ions of: 
4  overlapping  calibrat ion  periods  (1996–2000,  1997–2000,  1998–2000,  and  1999–
•
2000),  
2  methods  for  handling  missing  data  on  the  evident iary  criteria  (default  failure  vs. 
random allocation),  
2 methods for mesothelioma and lung cancer forecasts (Nicho lson vs. Peto), and  
2 methods for other cancer and nonmalignancy forecasts (ratio vs. regression).  

•
•

•

Florence  implicit ly assumed  that  the median  forecast would be  the best summarizat ion o f his 
calculat ions.   This  is  not  correct.   The best  summarizat ion would  be  near  the  high  end  of  his 
range or possibly above the high end.  

Any  modificat ion  to  Florence’s  result s  based  on  the  issues  raised  in  Opinion  4  would  be 
dist inct  from  the  modificat ions  that  would  be  required  to  respond  to  the  inadequacies 
ident ified in Opinions 1–3.  

This opinion  is  based  on my  review  of  Sections  5.0–6.0 of his  report,  and  related material  in 
his Appendices, and in references contained therein.  

Calibration Periods

Florence stated (page 18):  

13

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 15 of 33

“A calibrat ion  period  is  selected  to  be  that  historical  period  that  is  expected  to  be 
most  reflective  o f  future  events.    The  range  of  calibration  periods:  1996–2000, 
1997–2000,  1998–2000,  and  1999–2000,  was  selected  so  as  to  include  sufficient 
years such that the influence of any single anomalous year would be mit igated.”

None of the four selected calibrat ion periods were “reflect ive o f future events.”  Examinat ion 
of Florence’s  Tables  5-1  and  5-2  shows  that  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  claims 
between 1999 and 2000, an increase that continued into 2001.  Bigg’s expert report (June 18, 
2007,  pp.  44–49)  documents  her  analysis  showing  that  the  number  of  claims  against  Grace 
would  have  cont inued  to  increase  through  2002–2003,  after  which  mesothelioma  claims 
would  continue  at  the  higher  rate,  lung  cancer  and  other  cancer  would  have  declined  to 
earlier levels, and nonmalignancies would have declined sharply below the earlier levels.  

Florence  implicit ly  treated  2000  as  if  it were  an  “anomalous  year.”   This would  have  been  a 
reasonable  assumpt ion  if  he  were  conducting  his  analysis  in  2001,  but  is  not  a  reasonable 
assumpt ion  for  an  analysis  conducted  in  2007.    At  this  t ime  the  claim  filing  patterns  for 
major  defendants  and  trusts were  known  for  the  years  2001–2006,  and  it was  not  reasonable 
for Florence to ignore such informat ion in making his current estimates.  Moreover, given the 
broad  range  o f  asbestos  defendants  and  trusts  listed  on  page  1  o f  his  report,  it  is  difficult  to 
imagine that Florence did not have access to such informat ion.  

Given  the  sharp  increases  in  mesothelioma  claim  filings  during  2000–2002  and  the  fact  that 
mesothelioma  represents  52–63%  of  the  liabilit ies  in  his  Table  6-3,  it  is  likely  that  an 
adequate  treatment of the changes  that occurred during 2001–2006 would  yie ld  substant ially 
higher  liability est imates.  

Missing Data on the Evidentiary Criteria

At three  points  in  his  report  (pages  9,  11,  12),  when  dealing  with  pending  claims,  Florence 
stated:  “…ARPC  had  no  data  to  calculate  how many,  if  any,  of  the  claimants  who  did  not 
respond had claims  that met  the criteria.”   Florence dealt with  this “missing data” problem  in 
two ways:
• Method  1  (default  failure)  assumed  that  all  claimants  who  did  not  respond  would 
have failed to meet the evident iary criteria.
• Method 2  (random allocat ion)  assumed  that  all  claimants who did not  respond would 
have  met  the  evidentiary  criteria  in  the  same  proportion  as  those  who  provided  the 
data.

In  the  absence  o f  evidence  to  the  contrary,  Method  2  is the  preferred  method because  it  is 
neutral with respect  to  the  assumptions  concerning  the  relat ive  success/failure  rates  o f  the 
respondents vs. non-respondents.  

Method 1 invo lves the very strong assumption that the absence of data is equivalent to failure 
to meet  the evident iary criteria.   The problem  in using Method 1  is  that  it  requires  the use of 
evidence  that  does  not  exist.    Florence  clearly  stated  that  “ARPC  had  no  data” on  the  non-
respondents, which means that he had  no  evidence  to  support  the default  failure  assumpt ion.   
Florence  could  have co llected addit ional  data  on  the  non-respondents  in  order  to  test  the
default  failure  assumpt ion,  but  he  did  not.    In  the  absence  o f  such  data,  there  is  simply  no

basis  for  validating  the  assumpt ion  and  no  basis  for  using the  assumpt ion  in  the  current  
estimat ion.  

Table 6-3  indicates  that  the median  liabilit ies  for Method  2  are  $1,043 million,  substant ially 
higher  than  the median  liabilit ies  of  $493  for Method  1,  or  the median  liabilit ies  of  $712  for 
the  combinat ion  of the  methods,  and  much  closer  to  the  high  end  of  the  range  of  the  32 
project ions ($1,314 million).  

Florence’s  applicat ion  o f  Method  2  to  “all  claimants”  included 84,476  but  excluded 29,172 
claimants  listed  in  his  Table  4.1 for  which  “there  was  no  possible  POC  match”  (page  5).  
This  exclusion  was  equivalent  to  assuming  that  these  claims  were  invalid  at  the  time  they 
were  filed,  and  was  done  without  presenting  any  supporting  evidence  (as  in  other 
applicat ions  of  Method  1).    Accounting  for  this  excluded  group  could  raise  the  liability 
estimates  for  pending  claims  by  34.5%  ($44 million)  if  they were  assumed  to  be  statist ically 
ident ical to the included claimants (as in other applicat ions o f Method 2).  

Florence’s  approach  of  combining  Methods  1  and  2  for  pending  claims  appears  to  be 
inconsistent with his unmodified use of Method 2 (random allocat ion) when he deals with the 
estimat ion of  the  fract ion o f clo sed claims  that would meet  the evidentiary criteria.   On page 
16–17  he uses  a  random  allocat ion  assumpt ion  “that  the historical  closed  claims would meet 
the criteria in the same proportion as the historical pending claims.”  

In  this  case,  however,  it  is  not  clear  why  he  did  not  use  the  Closed  Claim  sample  to  make 
these  estimates.   Moreover,  to  the  extent  that  the  closed  claims  represented  stronger  claims 
than  the  claims  that  were  pending  at  the  t ime  of  bankruptcy,  one  would  expect  that  the 
fraction  o f  closed  claims  that  would  meet  the  evident iary  criteria  would  be  higher  than  the 
corresponding  fract ion  of  pending  claims,  implying  that  the  random  allocat ion  method  is 
downwardly biased.  

Mesothelioma and Lung Cancer Forecasts

The  mesothelioma  and  lung  cancer  forecasts  form  the  core  of  Florence’s  est imat ion 
procedures.    As  detailed  in  his  Appendix  I,  he  used two  different  methods  to  conduct  these 
forecasts.  

The  first method was a 1991 modificat ion o f  the Nicho lson’s 1982 method  (see Nicho lson et 
al. 1982) prepared by Vasquez in cooperation with Nicho lson, termed the “Nicho lson/KPMG 
Method”.    The  second  was a  procedure  termed  the  “Peto/ARPC  Model”  or  “Peto/ARPC 
Method.”  

The  methods  can  be  dist inguished  by  their  approach  to  the  estimat ion  o f  the  size  o f  the 
populat ion that was exposed  to asbestos  in  the past.   The Nicholson/KPMG Method  is based 
on historical data on occupations with asbestos exposure; the Peto/ARPC Method is based on 
estimates  from  the  OSHA  dose-response  models  of  the  implied  size  of  the  population that 
was  exposed  to  asbestos,  given  that  the  number  of  cases  of  asbestos-related  lung  cancer  or 
mesothelioma was known.  

15

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 17 of 33

With  estimates  o f  the  size  of  the  population,  one  can  generate  valid  forecasts  of  future  lung 
cancer  or mesothelioma  diagnoses  or  deaths  using  a  variety  o f  methods.   Unfortunately,  the 
methods  chosen  by  Florence  do  not  lead  to valid  forecasts;  instead  they  produce  forecasts 
that  are  downwardly  biased  and  are  based  on  inconsistent  or  contradictory  assumpt ions.    I 
document these points below.

Nicholson/KPMG Method

The  Nicho lson/KPMG  Method  was  based  on  Vasquez’s  1991  work.    As  noted  by  Vasquez 
(1991,  page  66),  this  method  produced  its  peak  mesothelioma  incidence  in  1995.    This 
deviated  sharply  from  the  later  peak  mesothelioma  incidence  in  2002  in  the  original 
Nicho lson  model  (Vasquez  1991,  page  67)  and  it  is  now  known  to  be  inconsistent  with the 
increasing  incidence  in U.S. Vital  Statist ics  through  at  least  2004  (see Biggs,  June  18,  2007, 
page  45).   A  reasonable  conclusion  is  that  the  changes made  by  Vasquez  were  in  the  wrong 
direct ion.    The  fact  that  Florence  took  Vasquez’s  version  o f  the  Nicho lson/KPMG  Method 
meant that he started with an inherently inferior model.  

As  noted  on  his  page  I-2,  Florence  was  aware  of  these  problems  with  Vasquez’s  version  o f 
the Nicho lson/KPMG Method and he attempted  to make ad hoc adjustments to that model  to 
match  the number o f claims  filed against Grace within  industry group and disease during his 
calibrat ion period 1996–2000.   One problem with  this adjustment was  that  it merely  rescaled 
Vasquez’s forecasts without resolving the inconsistency between the t iming o f the peaks and, 
derivat ively,  of  the  rate  of  decline  fo llowing  the  peaks.    A  second  problem  was  that  the 
chosen calibrat ion period 1996–2000 was not “reflective o f  future events,” as noted above  in 
the section ent itled “Calibrat ion Periods.”

The  Nicho lson/KPMG  Method  was  based  on  exposures  to  asbestos  that  began  during  the 
period  1930–1979.    Exposures  beginning  in  1980  and  later  are  not  represented.    This 
omission is inconsistent with the results in Table 2 of Anderson’s June 11, 2007 expert report 
which  indicates  that  Grace  exposures  cont inued  up  to  1993.    The  omission  of  persons  with 
exposures  init iating  during  the  period  1980–1993  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
forecasted  liabilit ies  because  these  persons  would  be  substant ially  younger  than  the  other 
exposed  persons  which  would  put  them  at  risk  fo r  one  to  two  decades  longer.    This  implies 
that the project ions  in Florence’s Table  J-1 would be  too  low  for all years, and especially  for 
the years after 2020 when the elapsed time since first exposure would put these persons at the 
highest risks of mesothelioma and lung cancer. 

Both  the original Nicho lson Method and Vasquez’s version o f  the Nicho lson/KPMG Method 
used  total  mortality  rates  for  males  from  U.S.  national  vital  statist ics  for  the  period  1975–
1979  and  assumed  that  these  held  constant  throughout  the  period  1980–2030  (Nicholson  et 
al.  1982,  p.  296).    The  constancy  assumpt ion  was  incorrect.    The  actual  mortality  rates 
declined at an average rate near 1% per year from 1979 to 2003 and are projected to continue 
to  decline  through  2030  and  beyond.    The  impact  of  these  declines  can  be  seen  by  the 
increase of male  life expectancy at age 65  from 14.0 years  in 1980  to 18.0 years  in 2030  (see 
Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Social  Security  Trust  Funds,  2007,  p.  81).    These  extra  4  years  of 
survival  at  the  end o f  life mean  that  there  is  significant  addit ional  t ime  for  the  emergence  o f 
asbestos-related  diseases  to  become  manifest.    The  Nicho lson  mortality  assumpt ions  are 

16

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 18 of 33

unrealist ically  conservative  and  the  result ing  project ions  are  downwardly  biased,  with 
increasingly larger errors for the later years of the project ions.  

In  an  email  to  counsel  for  the  Future  Claimants’  Representative dated  September  17,  2007, 
Grace's counsel, E lli Leibenstein (of Kirkland & Ellis), stated: 

“Attached  is  a  table  with  ARPC's  KPMG  incidence  numbers  that  ARPC  has 
been  using  since  2001.    In  2001,  ARPC  updated  the  KPMG  model  by 
updating  the  average  ages  for  entrants  into  the  workforce  (to  better  fit  the 
SEER age distribut ion) and the mortality tables.”  

However,  the  attachment  to  that  email  showed  that  the  peak  mesothelioma  incidence  st ill 
occurred  in  1995  so  that  ARPC’s  2001  update  did  not  resolve  the  problems  with  the  peak 
incidence  ident ified in the prior paragraph.  

In describing the OSHA models on page I-1, Florence stated: 

“…  no  peer  reviewer  challenged  the  mathematical  equat ions  devised  by 
OSHA  in  its  models  to  predict  risk  o f  lung  cancer  and  mesothelioma  from 
asbestos  exposure.   The  consensus was  that  the data behind  their  assumpt ions 
were  correct  and  that  the  models  were  appropriate  and  acceptable  means  of 
risk  assessment.    The  dose-response  models  presented  in  the  1986  [OSHA] 
report  have  never  been  revised  and  have  been  adopted  by  several  other 
regulatory and scient ific bodies for use in risk assessments.”  

Apparent ly he failed to notice that evident iary criterion 3 on page 2 of his report const ituted a 
complete reject ion o f  the OSHA model.   This criterion states  that a diagnosis of asbestosis  is 
necessary for  the  causat ion  of  lung  cancer  to  be  validly  attributed  to  asbestos  exposure.  
Roggli  explained  on  pages  3–4 of  his  report why this  criterion is wrong.   On page  I-3 of his 
report, Florence  listed the  four  components  of  the OSHA model.    It  is  clear  from this  list ing 
that  none  of  the  four  components  included any  requirement  or  even  ment ion  o f  a  ro le  for  
asbestosis to generate increased risk of lung cancer.  

Florence  failed  to  notice  that  if  criterion  3  on  page  2 were  correct,  then  it would  necessarily 
fo llow  that  the  OSHA  model  would  be  wrong,  and  that  any  forecast  based  on  the  OSHA 
model would  be  wrong.    His  assumpt ion  that  criterion  3  on  page  2  is  correct  is  inconsistent 
with his  assumpt ion  that  the  OSHA  model  in  also  correct.    Logically,  one  of  these  two 
assumpt ions must be wrong.

This  inconsistency  leads  to  the conclusion  that Flo rence’s  lung cancer project ions are wrong, 
regardless o f whether  asbestosis  is  or  is  not  “a  necessary  precursor  in  order  to  attribute  lung 
cancer to asbestos exposure” (as asserted by David Weill, October 3, 2006, p. 20).  

Peto/ARPC Method

Florence’s  report contains very  few details concerning his  implementation of  the Peto/ARPC 
Method.    Given  that  it  is  basically  an  alternat ive  method  of  estimat ing  the  size  of  the 
populat ion that  was  exposed  to  asbestos  in  the  past,  and  that  it  employs  the  OSHA  mode l 
17

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 19 of 33

with constant mortality, all o f the problems with the Nicho lson/KPMG Method would also be 
problems  with  this  alternat ive  method,  except  the  problem  relat ing  to  the  shift  o f the  peak 
mesothelioma year from 2002 to 1995.  

Other Cancer and Nonmalignancy Forecasts

Florence used two methods for his forecasts of claims for other cancers and for nonmalignant 
diseases.   The first method was a “ratio method” based on  the use of  the projected number of 
lung  cancer  claims  as  an  “index  series”  for  the  claims  due  to  other  cancers, with  the method 
repeated  separately  for  claims  due  to  nonmalignant  diseases.    For  each  type  of  claim,  the 
ratio  was  presumably  held  constant  throughout  the  project ion  period.    The  second  method 
was  a  “regression  method”  that  used  the  natural  logarithm  o f  the  number  o f  lung  cancer 
claims  to predict  the natural  logarithm o f  the number of claims due to other cancers, with the 
method repeated separately for claims due to nonmalignant diseases.  

The ratio method is wrong for nonmalignancies, for two reasons:  

• The assumption that the ratio would be constant over even a short time is proven false 
by  Bigg’s  expert  report  (June  18,  2007,  pp.  44–49)  which  documents  her  analysis 
showing  that  the  number  of  claims  against  Grace  would  have  cont inued  to  increase 
through 2002–2003, after which  lung cancer and other cancer would have declined  to 
earlier  levels  while  nonmalignancies  would  have  declined  sharply  below  the  earlier 
levels.  
• The assumption  that  the  ratio would be constant over a  longer  time  is proven  false by 
the  finding  in  my  analysis  that  the  rate  of  increase  in  claim  filings  as  a  funct ion  o f 
time since  first exposure  is  faster  for malignancies  than  for nonmalignancies (Stallard 
et al. 2005, p. 228).  

The  rat io method  is  wrong  both  for  other  cancers  and  nonmalignancies  for  the  addit iona l 
reason  that  the  underlying  forecast  of  lung  cancer  which  serves  as  the  “index  series”  is 
wrong.  

The  “regression  method”  is a  generalizat ion  of  the  rat io method  in  which  the  number  o f 
claims due  to other  cancers  (or  separately due  to nonmalignant  diseases)  is  proportional,  not 
to  the number of  lung  cancer  claims, but  to  a power of  the number of  lung  cancer  claims.    If 
the  power  were  exactly  1.0,  the  two  methods  would  yield  ident ical  results.    This  method  is 
subject  to  the  same  three  problems  ident ified  above  for  the  ratio  method,  and  hence  fails  to 
produce valid forecasts for the same reasons.  

In  addit ion  to  the  problems  noted  above  in  forecasting  the  number  o f  future  claims  for  lung 
cancer,  other  cancers,  and  nonmalignant  diseases,  it  is worth  emphasizing  that  the  est imated 
costs  for  58,241  pending  and  future  claims  for  these  three  disease  categories  were  based  on 
just  7  closed  claims  with  settlement  values  that  ranged  from  $1,538  to  $76,875  (Figure  2).  
The est imated costs for  the 4,284 pending and future claims for mesothelioma were based on 
just  21  closed  claims  with  settlement  values  that  ranged  from  $15,375  to  $768,750  (Figure 
1).  

18

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 20 of 33

In this particular analysis, the uncertainty in the forecasted numbers of valid claims combines 
mult iplicatively with the  uncertainty  in  the  settlement  values  assumed  to  apply  to  those 
claims  to  produce  a  set  of  estimates  that  are  so  highly  uncertain  that  they cannot  be 
considered  to have any valid  role  in  the context of generat ing unbiased and reliable est imates 
of Grace’s asbestos-related  liabilit ies in the case currently before the Court.  

5. Florence’s  report  makes  numerous  assumpt ions,  many  o f  which  have  an  unquant ified  or 
unquant ifiable degree of uncertainty. Since each assumpt ion builds upon other assumpt ions, 
the  cumulat ive degree o f uncertainty quickly  reaches  the po int where  the  report's  est imate  is 
unreliable, and indeed, surpasses that point when consideration is given to the issues raised in 
Opinions 1–4.  

In  addit ion,  the  basis  and  reasons  for  these  numerous  assumpt ions  are  not  completely  stated 
in  the  report, making  it  difficult  both  to  assess  their  validity  and  to  determine whether  there 
are  addit ional  issues  that  would  have  been  raised  by  me  in  this  rebuttal  report  had  a  more 
forthright  statement been provided.   Moreover,  statements  such  as  those on page 10 – “Fina l 
numbers will be  included after  the addit ional  review  is completed” – led me  to conclude  that 
the  June  18,  2007  version  of  the  report  was  not  intended  to  be  the  final  version,  and  that 
addit ional revisions could be expected.  

In the fo llowing, I discuss several o f these problematic assumptions.

On  page  7,  Florence  excluded  5,063  claims  from  the  CMS  database  because  they  had 
diagnosis  dates  or  date-filed  dates  after  the  bankruptcy  petit ion  date  of  April  2,  2001.    He 
provided no details concerning how many o f these claims filed a POC, nor did he indicate the 
number  o f claims  with reject ions  based  on  each  type  o f  date.    It  is  incorrect  to  exclude  a 
claim  with a  valid  POC  that  was  filed  prior  to  the  pet it ion  date  regardless  of  the  recorded 
diagnosis  date.    Alternatively,  even  if  some portion  of  the  claims  were  filed  after  the 
bankruptcy,  they  still  could  provide  valuable  info rmat ion  about  the  characterist ics  o f  future 
claims early  in  the period between  the bankruptcy and  the present and hence should not have 
been ignored in the analysis.

On  page  7,  Florence  excluded  29,172  of  113,648  claims  from  the  CMS  database,  after 
excluding  the  5,063  claims  indicated  above,  because  he  could  not  obtain  a  match  between 
their CMS record and the POC records.   His analytic workfile therefore was based on 84,476 
claims.    Had  he  matched  the 29,172  claims,  his  analyt ic  workfile  would  have  been  34.5% 
larger,  and  had  he  retained  all  o f  the  5,063  claims  in  addit ion,  his  analyt ic  workfile  would 
have been 40.5% larger.  

The  exclusion  of  such  large  fract ions  of  pending  claims  can  substant ially  downwardly  bias 
the  est imates  in  two  ways.    First,  the  historical  claim  filing  counts  used  in  calibrating  the 
project ions will  appear  to  be  substant ially  smaller  than  they  actually were.   Second,  the  total 
settlement value assigned to the pending claims will appear to be substant ially smaller than it  
should  be.    Florence’s  report  provides  insufficient  just ification  for  these  exclusions  and 
insufficient  detail  to  assess  the  size  o f  the  impact  on  the  est imates.    Florence’s  report  does 
provide  enough  informat ion to  state  qualitat ively  that  the  impact  could  be  large,  i.e.,  up  to 
34.5–40.5% as indicated in the prior paragraph.  

19

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 21 of 33

On  page  8,  Florence  excluded  10,322  POCs  because  he  could  not  match  them  to  the  PIQ 
database.    This  meant  that  the  PIQ  database  contained only 74,154  of  the  113,648  claims 
from  the  CMS  database,  after  excluding  the  5,063  claims  indicated  above.    Had  he matched 
both  the  29,172  and  the  10,322  claims,  his  analytic workfile would  have  been  53.3%  larger, 
and had he retained all o f the 5,063 claims  in addition, his analyt ic workfile would have been 
60.1%  larger.    Alternat ively,  the  PIQ  database  represents  only  62.5%  of  the  claims  he 
ident ified as being in the CMS database.  It is completely unknown how the characterist ics o f 
the  excluded  37.5%  of  the  claims  would  compare  to  the  retained  62.5%  of  the  claims  with 
respect  to  the  informat ion  on  the  PIQ.    This  lack  of  knowledge  generates  a  potentially  large 
source of uncertainty that is not quantifiable based on the informat ion in Florence’s report.  

On  page  10,  Florence  appeared  to  have  assumed  that  x-ray evidence  not  available  for  lung 
cancer  claimants  in  his  study  would  not  be  available  at  time  of  trial.    This  assumption  was 
confusing  because  he  stated  that  he  assumed  that  “such  evidence would  not  be  available  for 
the estimation trial” (bo ldface mine, not his),  rather  than  for  the  trial  in  the  tort system.  The 
unavailability  o f  evidence  at  the  time  o f  the  PIQ  submission  is  not  the  same  thing  as 
unavailability o f evidence at the time of trial.   Florence's  improper assumpt ion excluded over 
half  (51%)  of  the  otherwise  valid  claims.    Moreover,  the  impact  of  this  assumpt ion  on  the 
liability est imate  is compounded because  the  lung cancer settlement values  for diseases other 
than mesothelioma were  assumed  to  be mult iplicatively  related  to  the  lung  cancer  settlement  
values.  

Throughout  his  report,  Florence  assumed  that  only  individuals  that  personally  mixed  or 
installed  asbestos  products  will  acquire  an  asbestos  related  disease  even  though,  as  Roggli 
observed  in his July 2007 expert report, people exposed to asbestos have developed asbestos-
related  diseases  who  did  not  mix  or  install  asbestos.    Florence's  criteria  thus  excluded 
potentially  valid  claims.    The  impact  of  this  exclusion  is  exceedingly  complex,  as  discussed 
above in Opinions 1 and 2, but it is reasonable to conclude that the impact is very large, even 
if  it is difficult to precisely quant ify how large it actually is.  

The  lung  cancer  causat ion  criteria  are  too  strict  because  an  asbestosis  diagnosis  is  not  a 
necessary precursor  to  asbestos  induced  lung  cancer  (see  Roggli’s  July 2007  expert  report).  
Thus Florence's criteria eliminated still other potentially valid claims. 

Although  Florence  uses  valuat ions  drawn  from  a historical  sample  that  actually  meets  his 
screening criteria, he failed to make any adjustment for the fact that Grace's share of the total 
liability  would  have  been  higher  because  many  plaint iffs  would  not  have  been  able  to 
establish  liability  against  some  or  all  o f  the  other  defendants.    Addit ional  discussion  o f  this 
issue  is  provided  above  in  Opinion  2  where  it  is  shown  that  the  numerical  impact  of  this 
effect is potentially very large.  

In  addit ion  to  the  other  problems  with  the  applicat ions  of  the  Nicho lson/KPMG and 
Peto/ARPC models  noted  above,  the  Nicho lson/KPMG and  Peto/ARPC run-o ffs  that 
Florence  used  were  based  on  different  exposure  criteria  than  Florence  used,  but  these 
differences  were  not  taken  into  account  in  his  estimat ion  procedure,  nor  did  he  provide  any 
results that would allow one to quantify the impact of these differences.

Florence’s assumpt ions  regarding  the  use  of  four  “calibrat ion  periods”  indicate  that  his 
estimates  are  subject  to  great  uncertainty. However,  the  fact  that  it  is  now  known  that  both 
the  claim filing  counts  and  the  settlement  values were  increasing  after  the  period  1999–2000 
means  that  none  of  his  calibrat ion  periods  were  “reflect ive  o f  future  events,”  as  he  assumed 
on page 18.  Thus the actual uncertainty o f his estimates must be substant ially larger than the 
amount he indicated in his report.  

On page 3, Florence reported  that  the  low end of his 32 est imates  indicated a  total  liability o f 
$385  million.    Compared  to  the  actual indemnity  payments  o f  $151  million  for  2000 (see 
page 26 o f Dunbar’s June 18, 2007 expert  report),  this amount barely allows  for 2.5 years o f 
payments  at  a  flat  annual  rate.    Given  that  both  the  claim  filing  counts  and  the  settlement 
values were  increasing  after  the  period  1999–2000,  the provision o f funds  for  only  2.5  years 
of payments would  appear  with  great  certainty  to  be woefully and  shockingly inadequate  to 
handle all claims expected to arise over the next 40–50 years.

STATEMENT OF OPINIONS 

1. Forecasts  of  the  number,  timing,  and  type  of  future  asbestos-related  personal  injury 
claims should be updated periodically.  Such updating can eliminate or reduce three types 
of errors: observed errors, unobserved errors, and errors of omission.

• Observed  errors  are  due  to  differences  between  the actual and  forecasted  values  that 
develop over  time and generally become increasing  larger as  the  interval between  the 
base  year  of  the  forecast  and  each targeted  future  year  increases.    Updating  can 
eliminate observed errors  occurring  in  the  period  between  the  base  year  of  the 
original  forecast  and  the  base  year  o f  the updated  forecast  and  reset  the  base  level  o f 
the claims in the updated forecast to match the latest observed levels.  
• Unobserved  errors  occur in  the  period  after  the  base  year  of  a  forecast  and  represent 
the  differences  between  the  yet-to-be-observed  actual  values  and  the  forecasted 
values. Unobserved  errors  occurring  after  the  base  year  o f  an  updated  forecast  will
generally be smaller than the corresponding errors in the original forecast because the 
size  of  the  errors  is  correlated  with  the  size  of  the  interval between  the  base  year  o f 
the forecast  and  any targeted  future  year,  and  this  interval will  be  smaller after  the 
updating  is  done.    In  other  words,  updating  can  reduce  the  uncertainty  o f  all 
forecasted future values to a level below that of the original forecast.  
• Errors  of  omission  are  due  to  the  inability  o f  the  original  forecast  to  account  for 
exposures  to  asbestos  beginning in  the  period  after  the  base  year  of the  original 
forecast. These  errors  can  be  eliminated  by  including  such  exposures  in  the  updated
forecast.8  

The basis o f this opinion is documented in Stallard (2001) and Stallard et al. (2005).  The
treatment of observed  and unobserved  errors  in  this opinion is generally  accepted  among 
professional  forecasters  and  is  not  controversial.  Biases  due  to  errors  of  omission  for  
later  exposures  are  frequent ly  ignored,  e.g.,  as  noted  above  in  Part  I  in  my  crit ique  o f 
Florence’s applicat ion o f the Nicho lson/KPMG Method which was based on exposures to 
asbestos  that began during  the period 1930–1979, with exposures  beginning  in  1980  and 

 
 
8 These errors will disappear in all updates performed after the exposures have ceased.

later not  represented.   My opinion  is  that  such  errors  should  be  explicit ly  considered  and 
appropriate adjustments made to correct for them.  

2. There are two general types of updat ing that are responsive to Opinion 1: part ial updat ing 
and global re-est imat ion of the ent ire model.  

• Partial updat ing,  described  in Stallard  (2001),  removes  the observed errors  that occur 
due  to  differences  between  the  actual  and  forecasted  values  during  the  updating 
interval, resets  the  base  level  of  the  claims  to match  the  latest  observed  levels,  while 
retaining  the  shape  (relat ive  timing) of  the  claim  runo ff process.   The resetting of  the 
base  levels reduces the  unobserved  errors  occurring  in  the  period  after  the  base  year 
of the  updated  forecast as  long  as  the  original  estimates  of  the  claim  runo ff  process 
remain valid.  Partial updat ing does not address errors of omission for later exposures.
The accuracy o f the result ing updated forecast will depend on the size of such errors.  
• Global  re-est imat ion  o f  the  ent ire  model  was  recommended  in  Stallard  (2001) as  an 
alternat ive  to  partial  updat ing  that  would  be  performed  relat ively  infrequent ly  due  to 
the greater effort  invo lved.   Global re-est imat ion allows one  to address all  three  types 
of errors, and can be conducted using methods similar to those described  in Stallard et 
al. (2005).  

The basis of this opinion  is also documented in Stallard (2001) and Stallard et al. (2005).  

UPDATED PROJECTIONS

Table  1  of my  June  18  report  (reference  6  in  the  first section)  presented  claim  runoffs  from  my 
1994 analysis of  the Manville Trust data.   These data were provided  to Jennifer L. Biggs for use 
in  generating  her  projected  claims.    My  understanding  was  that  her  use  of  these  data  was 
restricted  to reliance on the  shapes (relat ive  timing) of  the claim runoffs, without reliance on  the 
base  levels (abso lute  numbers  o f  claims  in  any  selected  base  year),  but  with  adjustments  for 
errors of omission for later exposures.  

Given  this applicat ion,  and  the  possibility  that  global  re-est imat ion  of  the  ent ire  model might 
produce different shapes (relat ive  timing) o f  the claim runoffs or different adjustments  for errors 
of omission for  later  exposures,  I  recommended  that  she  consider  using  updated  claim  runoffs 
based  on  a  global  re-est imat ion  o f  the  ent ire  model using  the  latest Manville  Trust  data  (for  the 
5-year period 2002–2006; see reference 8 in the first section).  

I  generated  updated  project ions  of  the  number  of  male  claims  against  the  Manville  Trust  by 
disease,  date  of  first  exposure,  and  date  of  claim  for  the  period  2005–2009  through  2055–2059, 
after  which  all claims  terminated, and  I  provided  these  supplemental  pro ject ions  to  Jennifer  L. 
Biggs for use in her supplemental/rebuttal expert report dated September 25, 2007.  

The updated claim runo ffs are summarized separately by disease and groupings of disease below 
in Tables 1–6. All o f the tables have the same format.

Table 1 presents  the project ions  for  all  asbestos-related  personal  injury  claims.   These  consist  of 
claims  for  malignancies  and  nonmaligancies.    The  total  projected  number  of  claims  is  355,556 
with 130,155  claims  projected  for  the  period  2005–2009.    The  ratio  of these  two  numbers  is 
23

Case 01-01139-KJC    Doc 17006-1    Filed 10/05/07    Page 25 of 33

called the “development factor” and has the value 2.73.  The total number of claims is thus equal 
to  2.73  times  the  number  projected  for  2005–2009.    The  development  factor  is  a  convenient 
summarizat ion  o f  the  shape  o f  the  claim  runo ff  curve.    A  large  development  factor  implies  that 
claims  will  be  filed  for  relat ively  many  years;  conversely,  a  small  development  factor  implies 
that claims will terminate relat ively early.  

Corresponding development factors are presented for each date of  first exposure, and  range  from 
1.00  for  1925–1929  exposure  starts  to  8.96  for  1980–1984  exposure  starts.    The  development 
factor  increases  by  a  factor  of  3.03  (from  2.96  to  8.96)  between exposure  starts  during  1970–
1974  and 1980–1984.    Overall,  18.3%  of projected  claims  are  projected  to  arise  from  exposure 
starts during 1975–1984.

The bottom three rows of Table 1 present, respectively:
• The updated projected total for exposure starts during 1915–1974.
• The corresponding original projected total for exposure starts during 1915–1974 from my 
1994  analysis  (obtained  from  the  asbestos-related  disease  categories  1–7  in  my  June  18 
report).
• The rat ios of the updated to the original projected totals, for exposure starts during 1915–
1974.

The  results  in  Table  1  show  that the  projected  number  o f  claims  increases  by  a  factor  of  2.44 
from  119,027  to  290,340 claims.    This  increase is consistent  with  increases  for  Grace  and  other 
asbestos defendants noted in Part I and in the other expert reports and with the  increases noted  in 
Stallard (2001) and Stallard et al. (2005).  

The  results  in Table 1 also show a 14% decline  in  the 1915–1974 development  factor,  from 2.90 
to 2.50.  This means that the updated projection starts at a higher level but declines more rapidly.  

Table 2 presents the corresponding results for claims for malignant disease injuries.

Compared  with Table  1,  the  results  in  Table  2  for  malignancies  indicate  a  very  significant  but 
smaller increase in the total number of claims, increasing by a factor of 1.91 compared to 2.44 in 
Table  1,  and  a  1%  increase  in  the  1915–1974  development  factor  (from  3.65  to  3.69)  compared 
to a 14% decrease in Table 1.  

Most  significant  is  the  finding  that  the  overall  development  factor  for  malignancies  is 
significant ly  higher  than  for  all  claims,  increasing  from  2.73  to  4.10.   Table  6  below  shows  that 
the  reason  for  this  difference  is  that  the  development  factor  for  nonmalignancies  is  substant ially 
lower,  at  2.46.    These  results  provide  addit ional  support  for  the opinion  stated  in  Part  I  that  the 
number  of  claims  for  nonmalignancies  cannot  be  validly  expressed  as  a  simple  rat io of the 
number of claims for malignancies.  

Table 3 presents the corresponding results for mesothelioma claims.  

Compared with Table  2, the  results  in Table  3  for mesothelioma  indicate  a  larger  increase  in  the 
total number  of  claims,  increasing  by  a  factor  of  2.31  compared  to  1.91  in  Table  2,  and  a  7% 
increase  in  the 1915–1974 development factor (from 3.71  to 3.97) compared  to a 1%  increase  in 
Table 2.  

The  7%  increase  in  the  mesothelioma  development  factor  is  consistent  with  results  reported  by 
the National Center for Health Statistics  in Health, United States 2006 (Table 48; reference 14 in 
the  first sect ion) showing  that mesothelioma deaths  cont inued  to  increase  at  least  to  2004.   This 
differs  from  earlier  results  reported  in  Stallard  (2001)  based  on  SEER  data  (reference  7  in  the 
first section) which  indicated  that mesothelioma  incidence  appeared  to  have  peaked  by  the mid-
1990s.    This  also  differs  from  the  Nicho lson/KPMG  Method  used  by  Florence  which  produced 
its  peak  mesothelioma  incidence  in  1995.    The  7%  increase  in  the  mesothelioma  development 
factor translates directly  into a 7% downward bias in all project ions that fail to take these updates 
into account.

Table  3  shows that  13.0%  of mesothelioma  claims  are  projected  to  arise  from  exposure  starts 
during 1975–1984, another source of downward bias in project ions such as Florence’s that fail to 
fully take these later exposure starts into account.

Table 6 presents the corresponding results for nonmalignant disease claims.  

Compared with Table 1, the results in Table 6 for nonmalignancies indicate a substant ially  larger 
increase  in  the  total  number  of  claims,  increasing  by  a  factor  of  2.71  compared  to 2.44 in Table 
1,  and  a  15%  decrease  in  the  1915–1974  development  factor  (from  2.63  to  2.44)  compared  to  a 
14% decrease in Table 1.  

Table  6  shows  that  20.0%  of  nonmaligancy  claims  are  projected  to  arise  from  exposure  starts 
during 1975–1984.  

The 15% decline  in  the 1915–1974 nonmalignancy development  factor  in Table 6 contrasts with 
the  1%  increase  in  the  1915–1974  malignancy  development  factor  in  Table  2,  and  the  7% 
increase  in  the  1915–1974  mesothelioma  development  factor  in  Table  3.    These  differences 
indicate that cancer claims, especially mesothelioma, will cont inue to be filed at a runoff rate that 
is at least as high as est imated in my 1994 analysis.
